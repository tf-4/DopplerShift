<li>
<p>This system was ported from Mojave Sun 13 and modified, where it was ported from Concordia and modified :3c</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The meat of the system is a process by which a user's message is received, processed into a list of pseudo-syllables and punctuation. Originally a regex was used to try and identify syllables, but due to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>English language conventions this is more complicated than this system really needs. Every three characters is detected, and then the first letter of that character is used to determine what sound is played. Punctuation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>plays no sound, but leaves an empty space to indicate it's use.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Currently the sound file must be passed as a sound datum. This was initially with the intention of using BYOND's in-built pitch on sound datums, but that sucks and has a bunch of weird issues. It does have the added benefit</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of giving a check to make sure we're actually passing a real sound file through to playsound_local, though.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>File format is as follows: [voice name]/[letter][variation].wav.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each vowel has twenty variations, while each consonant has six.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An Audacity macro to make the sounds less irritating on the ear was made and used to process each voice. It can be found in the initial PR related to this system.</p>
